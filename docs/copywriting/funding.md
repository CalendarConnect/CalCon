# The First Calendar Network

A Note from Christian Bleeker, Founder

The AI revolution is here. OpenAI's Operator, GPT-powered Siri, and a wave of AI agents are transforming how professionals work. But there's a critical missing piece: How do AI agents schedule meetings across organizations while protecting privacy?

The answer is clear: they need a calendar network.

## Why a Calendar Network is Essential Now

As AI agents become mainstream, they face a fundamental challenge:
- An OpenAI agent can't see Google Calendar availability
- Siri can't coordinate with Outlook calendars
- AI assistants can't schedule across organizations
