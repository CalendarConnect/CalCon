# Polar.sh Documentation

## Overview
Polar.sh is used in this codebase to manage subscription billing and payment processing. It facilitates seamless integration of subscription services, automates subscription handling, and ensures secure payment transactions.

## Integration in the Codebase
- **Client Integration:** The Polar.sh client is integrated via a dedicated module (e.g., `lib/polarClient.ts`) to maintain centralized configuration.
- **Server-Side Usage:** Subscription validations and billing-related API calls are implemented in server-side code, ensuring that subscription operations are securely processed on the backend.
- **UI Integration:** Frontend components display subscription details and manage user interactions for plan upgrades, downgrades, or renewals, all while reflecting the current subscription status.

## Setup & Configuration
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive data such as API keys and service identifiers for Polar.sh are stored securely in environment variables.
- **Configuration Files:** Connection parameters and other settings for Polar.sh are defined within the backend configuration, ensuring secure and consistent initialization of the payment services.
- **Type Safety:** The integration leverages TypeScript definitions to enforce type-safe interactions with the Polar.sh API, reducing runtime errors.

## Subscription Management
- **Predefined Plans and Trials:** The codebase manages multiple subscription plans and trial periods to accommodate different user needs.
- **Billing Operations:** Core functionality includes creating subscriptions, processing renewals, and handling cancellations through dedicated API endpoints.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to manage payment failures, subscription errors, and API rate limits.

## Codebase References
- **Initialization:** Refer to `lib/polarClient.ts` for the Polar.sh client setup and configuration.
- **Server Operations:** Review the API routes and server-side modules that handle subscription and billing logic for real-world usage examples.

## Best Practices
- Always rely on the generated TypeScript types for interacting with the Polar.sh API.
- Ensure the secure handling of all sensitive data including API keys and transaction information.
- Follow established subscription management workflows to maintain consistency across the codebase.
