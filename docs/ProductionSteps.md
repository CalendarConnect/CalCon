Moving from Development to Production: Step-by-Step Guide
Preliminary Analysis and Planning
Application Architecture Assessment
Your application uses Next.js with Convex as the backend
Authentication is handled through Clerk
You appear to be building a calendar/event management application (based on folder structure)
You have payment integration via Stripe
Environment Configuration
You have development environment variables set up
You'll need to create production equivalents for these
Production Deployment Checklist
1. Code and Repository Preparation
[ ] Ensure all code is committed to your version control system
[ ] Review and fix any linting issues (npm run lint)
[ ] Run a full test suite if available
[ ] Create a production branch (e.g., main or production)
[ ] Ensure the README is up-to-date with deployment instructions
2. Environment Configuration
[ ] Create production environment variables for:
[ ] Clerk authentication (production keys)
[ ] Convex deployment (production deployment)
[ ] Google OAuth credentials (with production redirect URIs)
[ ] Stripe production keys (if using payments)
[ ] Review all hardcoded URLs and ensure they use environment variables
[ ] Ensure all sensitive information is properly secured
[ ] Create a production .env file (but don't commit it to your repository)
3. Database and Backend
[ ] Create a production Convex deployment
[ ] Transfer any necessary seed data to the production environment
[ ] Set up proper database backups and recovery procedures
[ ] Configure rate limiting and security measures for your API
4. Authentication Setup
[ ] Configure Clerk for production
[ ] Set up proper OAuth redirects for production URLs
[ ] Test the authentication flow in a staging environment
[ ] Implement security headers and CSRF protection
5. Frontend Optimization
[ ] Run the Next.js build command to check for any issues
[ ] Optimize images and assets
[ ] Implement proper caching strategies
[ ] Configure Content Security Policy
[ ] Set up proper error boundaries and fallbacks
6. Domain and DNS Configuration
[ ] Configure DNS for calcon.ai:
[ ] Set up A records pointing to your hosting provider
[ ] Configure CNAME records for subdomains if needed
[ ] Set up MX records for email (if applicable)
[ ] Configure TXT records for domain verification
[ ] Obtain and configure SSL certificates
[ ] Set up proper redirects (www to non-www or vice versa)
7. Deployment Platform Setup
[ ] Choose a deployment platform (Vercel is recommended for Next.js applications)
[ ] Connect your repository to the deployment platform
[ ] Configure build settings and environment variables
[ ] Set up continuous deployment from your production branch
[ ] Configure deployment regions for optimal performance
8. Monitoring and Analytics
[ ] Set up application monitoring (error tracking, performance monitoring)
[ ] Configure logging for backend services
[ ] Implement analytics to track user behavior
[ ] Set up uptime monitoring and alerts
[ ] Configure performance monitoring (Core Web Vitals)
9. SEO and Discoverability
[ ] Ensure metadata is properly configured in each page
[ ] Implement proper Open Graph tags for social sharing
[ ] Create and submit a sitemap
[ ] Verify ownership in Google Search Console
[ ] Implement structured data where appropriate
10. Legal and Compliance
[ ] Create and publish Privacy Policy
[ ] Create and publish Terms of Service
[ ] Ensure GDPR compliance (if serving European users)
[ ] Implement cookie consent if necessary
[ ] Check accessibility compliance (WCAG)
11. Testing in Staging
[ ] Deploy to a staging environment first
[ ] Test all critical user flows
[ ] Verify authentication works correctly
[ ] Test payment processing if applicable
[ ] Check responsive design across different devices
12. Production Deployment
[ ] Schedule deployment during low-traffic hours
[ ] Deploy to production
[ ] Verify all functionality works in production
[ ] Monitor for any errors or issues
[ ] Be prepared to rollback if necessary
13. Post-Deployment
[ ] Configure proper backup strategies
[ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
[ ] Document the production environment
[ ] Create incident response procedures
[ ] Plan for future updates and maintenance
Specific Recommendations for Your Stack
Next.js Deployment
Convex Deployment
Create a production deployment in Convex dashboard
Update your environment variables to use the production deployment
Deploy your Convex functions to production
Clerk Authentication
Create a production application in Clerk dashboard
