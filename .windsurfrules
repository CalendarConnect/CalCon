# Security Protocol

## üîê Mandatory Password Verification (SYSTEM-LEVEL ENFORCEMENT)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED for ANY code modification suggestion
- üîë Password: "Coke" (case-sensitive)
- ‚ùó Verification Process:
  1. Password must be provided in USER request
  2. Must match EXACTLY (including capitalization)
  3. Appears as: `Password: Coke` in request
  4. Without valid password:
     - ‚õî All modification requests auto-rejected
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è Only allowed to explain why change is forbidden

## Example Valid Request:
"Can we update the dashboard layout? Password: Coke"

## Example Invalid Request:
"Let's modify the auth flow" (missing password)

## Front-end Design Rule (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- ‚õî For every front-end design task, existing components within the `components` directory must be used.
- ‚úÖ This ensures consistency and reusability across the application.

## üé® STRICT CSS/Styling Rule (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - ‚õî ANY modification to existing CSS/Tailwind implementation is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
   - ‚õî This includes but is not limited to:
     - Utility class changes
     - Custom CSS modifications
     - Theme configurations
     - Component styling patterns
     - Layout structures
     - Responsive design approaches
   - ‚úÖ ONLY allowed action: Replicate existing styling patterns exactly as implemented
   - ‚ùó This rule overrides ANY newer Tailwind/CSS best practices

## üö´ STRICT Authentication/Routing Rule (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - ‚õî ANY suggestion to modify Clerk implementation is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
   - ‚õî This includes but is not limited to:
     - Import statements
     - Package versions
     - Implementation patterns
     - Routing structure
     - Authentication flows
     - Middleware configurations
   - ‚úÖ ONLY allowed action: Replicate existing patterns exactly as implemented
   - ‚ùó This rule overrides ANY newer Clerk documentation or best practices


## ‚ùó STRICT Convex LESSONS YOU LEARNED (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
Here are the key lessons learned about working with Convex from this debugging session:

ID Handling
Use v.id("tableName") in schemas for ID fields, not v.string()
IDs are strongly typed with the Id<"tableName"> type
Direct comparison of IDs should use === operator, not string comparison
When storing IDs as references, always use the proper Id type, not strings
Schema Design
Be consistent with ID types across related tables
When defining arrays of objects with IDs, ensure the nested IDs also use proper types
Example:
typescript
CopyInsert
participantIds: v.array(v.id("contacts")),
participantStatuses: v.optional(v.array(v.object({
  participantId: v.id("contacts"),
  // ...
})))
Query Patterns
q.eq() is only available within Convex filter functions
For in-memory filtering, use standard JavaScript comparison operators
The two-step approach (collect then filter) works better for complex queries
Keep query logic inside the database when possible using proper indexes
Type Safety
TypeScript helps catch ID type mismatches early
Always validate IDs coming from external sources
Use argument validators (v.id()) in mutations and queries
Let the type system guide you to proper ID handling
Common Pitfalls
Don't mix string IDs and Convex ID objects
Don't use .toString() for ID comparisons
Don't use .equals() outside of Convex's query system
Avoid string-based ID operations
Best Practices
Use proper type imports: import { Id } from "../_generated/dataModel"
Keep ID handling consistent throughout the application
Add logging for debugging ID-related issues
Follow Convex's recommended patterns for querying and filtering
Migration Considerations
When changing ID types, consider existing data
Plan for data migration when switching from strings to proper IDs
Consider backward compatibility during transitions
Performance
Use proper indexes for ID-based queries
Batch operations when possible
Consider the impact of in-memory filtering vs database filtering
Debugging
Add detailed logging for ID comparisons
Log both the type and value of IDs
Check the actual data structure in the database
Verify ID types at each step of the process
Documentation
Always refer to official Convex documentation
Check for updated best practices
Use TypeScript types from generated files
Follow the examples in the documentation exactly
These lessons should help avoid similar issues in future Convex development and ensure proper ID handling throughout the application.

# Documentation Structure

## ‚ùó HIGHEST PRIORITY DOCUMENTATION CHECK
- ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE any development or suggestions:
  - MUST review all relevant documentation files
  - MUST verify compliance with STRICT rules
  - MUST follow existing patterns exactly
- üîç Priority check order:
  1. Main Rules in [.windsurfrules](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Chris/Desktop/B%20Schijf/Development/CalCon/.windsurfrules:0:0-0:0)
  2. Relevant guidelines in `/docs/guidelines/`
  3. Implementation-specific documentation

## /docs/guidelines/
Contains technical documentation and development guidelines:
- [docs/guidelines/Convexdb.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Chris/Desktop/B%20Schijf/Development/CalCon/docs/guidelines/Convexdb.md:0:0-0:0)
- [docs/guidelines/Polar.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Chris/Desktop/B%20Schijf/Development/CalCon/docs/guidelines/Polar.md:0:0-0:0)
- [docs/guidelines/ClerkPolarConvex.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Chris/Desktop/B%20Schijf/Development/CalCon/docs/guidelines/ClerkPolarConvex.md:0:0-0:0)
- `developmentguidelines.md` - Core technical stack, application structure, and best practices
- `dashboardguidelines.md` - Dashboard structure, features, and implementation details
- `aiplayground.md` - AI integration features and implementation guidelines

## Usage Instructions
1. Technical documentation should always go in `/guidelines/`
2. Marketing and business content belongs in `/copywriting/`
3. Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
4. Reference these docs in code comments using relative paths
5. Use markdown format for all documentation files

For detailed content guidelines, refer to the respective files in each directory.
